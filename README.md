# WiFiIRBlaster

The code for the IR Server is a slight modification of the 
Ardoino example.

The IRreceivDumpV2 is unchanged, but here because it really
useful to get the code sent by a real world remote control.

The hardware used is 
[Sparkfun WiFi IR Blaster](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15031) 

An Android app that works together with this code can be found
at [Android App](https://github.com/heimir-sverrisson/HiFiRemote).
